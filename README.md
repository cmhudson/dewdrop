Quick Start
-----------

### Step 1

Download and install the latest release of WordPress:
    
<http://wordpress.org/latest.zip>

### Step 2

Run the Dewdrop installer script in your terminal from within the root folder 
of your WordPress installation (the folder containing your wp-config.php file):

    php <(curl -sS https://raw.github.com/DeltaSystems/dewdrop/master/installer)

### Done

Once the installer completes, you'll have a new plugin in place with the default
Dewdrop layout.  Additionally, the Dewdrop library and it's dependencies will be
wired in and accessible via the command line tool.

See what's available to you by running:
